Hi there! Welcome to my profile! I hope you enjoy it!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Back-end Developer (Node.js, Typescript)
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying design patterns and TDD
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm working on private projects, but eventually I'll publicate more public repositories with typescript and node.j, etc.
